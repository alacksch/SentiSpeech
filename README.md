# 🎤 SentiSpeech: Speech Emotion Recognition using SVM

**SentiSpeech** is a machine learning project that detects and classifies human emotions from speech using audio feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Built on the RAVDESS dataset, the system analyzes vocal characteristics like pitch, tone, and energy to recognize emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry** and more.

- 1440 recordings
- 8 emotions (each with normal & strong intensity)
- Neutral North American accent
